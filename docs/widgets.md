# Widget contract

A widget is a folder with `Manifest.qml` and the slot files it lists. The full
contract lives as the header comment in
[`WidgetManifest.qml`](../dots/.config/quickshell/ii/modules/widgets/WidgetManifest.qml);
this page is the public, browsable half of it, kept in sync with the slots and
option types below by `tests/verify-widget-docs.sh`. Start from
[`ii-widget-hello`](https://github.com/Berupor/ii-widget-hello) instead of an
empty folder.

Required properties are `widgetId` and `minShellVersion`; everything else on
`WidgetManifest` has a sane default. `dependencies` lists binaries checked with
`command -v` - missing ones grey out the card. `options` are read back with
`WidgetCatalog.option(widgetId, key)` or `optionValue(key)` from the manifest
itself, never restated as a literal default anywhere else. An option with a
`label` is drawn on the card by the catalog; one without is for `settingsPage`
to render, which lands inside the card so it wants `ContentSubsection`, not
`ContentSection`.

## Slots

| Slot               | Since | Required fields | Notes                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `barIndicator`     | 1.0   | -               | Bar icon. Also drawn in the vertical bar if `orientations` lists it.                                               |
| `barGauge`         | 1.3   | -               | Resource-circle style: icon plus a number, next to CPU/RAM in the bar.                                             |
| `barUtilButton`    | 1.0   | -               | Bar utility button. Horizontal bar only - the vertical one has no utility group.                                   |
| `backgroundWidget` | 1.0   | -               | Desktop background layer, stays loaded while enabled - gate side effects on your own option.                       |
| `catalogView`      | 1.0   | -               | Replaces the whole Widgets settings page.                                                                          |
| `settingsView`     | 1.0   | -               | Replaces the whole settings window, titlebar included.                                                             |
| `regionAction`     | 1.0   | `name`          | Offered during region selection (ipc `region widget <name>`). Exposes `available` and `perform(path, x, y, w, h)`. |
| `sidebarLeftTab`   | 1.0   | `name`, `icon`  | Tab in the left sidebar.                                                                                           |
| `sidebarRightTab`  | 1.0   | `name`, `icon`  | Tab in the right sidebar.                                                                                          |

A slot entry is a bare path string, or an object carrying `path` plus the fields
above. Bar slots (`barIndicator`, `barGauge`, `barUtilButton`) also take
`orientations: ["horizontal", "vertical"]`, default `["horizontal"]` - a bar host
only draws a widget for the orientations it lists.

## Option types

- `switch` - boolean, drawn as `ConfigSwitch`.
- `spinBox` - numeric stepper, takes `min`/`max`/`step`.
- `textField` - free text, takes `placeholder`, committed to the store on a short debounce.

## Versions

`WidgetCatalog.shellVersion` is the contract's version, not the shell's or the
repo's: minor up when it grows (a slot, a manifest property, an option type),
major up when it breaks. A widget's `minShellVersion` has to match the same
major and be no newer than the shell's, or its card shows "Built for shell X,
this is Y" and it does not load. 1.0 is the baseline; 1.1 added `textField`;
1.2 added `orientations` for the vertical bar; 1.3 added `barGauge` and
`WidgetSlot.spacingBefore`.

## External widgets

Installed at `~/.config/illogical-impulse/widgets/<id>/`, outside the shell
tree, by pasting a git url on the Widgets page. Same contract as a bundled
widget, two differences: its own singletons need a `qmldir` next to them
(`singleton Foo 1.0 Foo.qml`), and it cannot `import` its own directory as a
module.

Native code, root access, udev rules, anything that needs to run without a
session - out of scope. List the binary in `dependencies`, explain it in your
README, the user installs it themselves. The catalog never ships or enables
executables of its own.

## Before publishing

`tests/design-lint.sh <your-repo>` and `tests/qml-cases.sh -x <your-repo>` clean,
store writes from a click handler (`onClicked`) rather than a binding
(`onCheckedChanged` loops on a store write, since the store recreates its data
object every time), and a `demo/` scene that doubles as your test and your
README screenshot - `ii-widget-hello` has the shape of all three.
